Existing CAS only perform either polyp detection (i.e. with or without polyps) or polyp type classification (neoplastic or non-neoplastic). In this study, a system that can perform both tasks simultaneously will be studied, i.e. by formulating the problem as a three-class image classification task (non-polyp, non-neoplastic polyp and neoplastic polyp). A set of unstructured endoscopic images, with clean labels, will be collected. Advanced machine learning technologies, including deep learning and transfer learning techniques with a novel architecture, will be implemented and evaluated on the set of endoscopic images.
